## Development

This project is a monorepo managed by `yarn` workspaces. It's highly recommended to use `yarn` to take advantage of the `yarn.lock` file to keep your dependencies in alignment with the maintainers of this project.

### Prerequisites

- **NodeJS** version equal to or higher than the one indicated in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/davidjerleke/embla-carousel/blob/master/.nvmrc).
- `yarn`

### Testing

This project uses `jest` for testing and a `jest.config.js` can be found inside each of the packages directories. To test a package run `yarn test` from within that package directory.

### Building

We use `rollup` to build the packages into `umd`, `esm`, and `cjs`. A configurations file `rollup.config.js` can be found in each of the packages directories. The master rollup configuration in the root directory is used to build all the packages at once.

## Bug reports

All bug reports require a reduced test case. Providing a test case is the best way to get any issue addressed. It helps us all to understand the problem. Without this, your issue **may be closed**. Please follow this checklist:

- **`Test case:`** Create one by forking one of the CodeSandboxes on the [examples page](https://www.embla-carousel.com/examples/). If applicable, choose the most relevant one.
- **`Test case exceptions:`** In rare cases a CodeSandbox might not be possible to provide. If this is the case, make sure to provide an alternative source like a GitHub repository or similar.
- **`Demonstrate:`** Make sure the test case clearly demonstrates the issue.
- **`Do not:`** Provide a link to a production site. That's not a test case.
- **`Create a Pull Request:`** If you want to solve the bug yourself, please make sure the branch name follows this pattern `bug/#<issue-number>`. Example: `bug/#543`.

## New features

For any new features it's important to follow this checklist:

- **`Discuss:`** Create a [new discussion](https://github.com/davidjerleke/embla-carousel/discussions/new?category=ideas) before creating an issue and/or starting any significant work. Let's discuss to see how the proposed feature fits within Embla Carousels's vision.
- **`Prettier:`** Make sure your editor adheres to prettier configuration files.
- **`Code style:`** Follow the current code style as described [here](#code-style).
- **`Create a Pull Request:`** Please make sure the branch name follows this pattern `feature/#<issue-number>`. Example: `feature/#543`.

## Documentation

The documentation website is generated using [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). All the content of the docs lives inside [`/packages/embla-carousel-docs`](https://github.com/davidjerleke/embla-carousel/tree/master/packages/embla-carousel-docs).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Make sure your node version is equal to the one in [.nvmrc](https://github.com/davidjerleke/embla-carousel/blob/master/.nvmrc). You can use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to easily install different node versions and switch between them with ease.

To develop the docs locally follow these steps:

- Run `yarn install` in the root directory to install dependencies.
- Run `yarn build` to build the docs (and all other packages).
- Run `yarn start` to start the dev environment of the docs at `localhost:8000`.
- Make sure the `.mdx` file you're working on has a header formatted like this:

```
---
title: [Page title here]
description: [Page description here].
order: [Page order here (a number)]
date: [Page last updated date (e.g. 2023-12-20)]
---
```

## Code style

All code contributions should follow the current `code style`. Please take your time to understand the current setup and don't introduce new styles that clearly deviates from the project `code style`.
